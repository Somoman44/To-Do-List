# To-Do-List
This is basic to-do list web app that stores stores your tasks as you input them.
you can mark the tasks as done, and delete them as well if you don't need them anymore.
It only uses the local storage of your browser, so no matter how many times you reopen it, it will show the same tasks(unless you clear the local storage.)
Enjoy!!
